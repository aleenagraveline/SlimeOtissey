# SER225 RPG Game

## What is this?
We programmed this game as part of the Quinnipiac University SER225 Class working in Scrum cycles from September, 9th 2024 to December, 4th 2024 with Bi-weekly sprint presentations.

This is Slime Otissey AKA the best game ever. We follow our Main character Alex and his new found best friend (Who just so happens to be a slime) through several biomes to make their way to King Lodeon in order to kill him and free the rest of the Slime Species. In order to do this, Alex and Otis have to solve puzzles, find keys, and gain friendship points with eachother. The moral of the story is that the real friends we made along the way... were the friends we made along the way.

## How to run this project?
I did not use any external libraries for this, so you can clone this repo as is and run it out of the box with Java (min version 8).
I recommend using an IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse to run this game.

The main method for the game is in the `Game` package > `Game.java` file.<br>
The main method for the map editor is in the `MapEditor` package > `MapEditor.java` file.
